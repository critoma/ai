Genetic Algorithm Enhanced Game for JDK 1.1 (final)
---------------------------------------------------

This directry (\JavaAI\game_jdk1.1) is an exact copy
of the directory \JavaAI\game, except the file
GeneticGame.java has one line added to init():

   this.requestFocus();

Please make sure to run Game.html with the appletviewer
from the JDK1.1 release (or later), and not with a browser
using the 1.0 API; for example, do not use Netscape Navigator
before release 4.0 (works, I just tested it) or Microsoft
Internet Explorer before release 4.0 (I don't have this yet,
so I have not tested it).

Also, please check my web site periodically for updates
on all of the software on this CD-ROM:

Best regards,
